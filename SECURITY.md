# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Security fixes are provided for:

- `main` branch (latest commit)
- latest tagged release (when available)

Older snapshots, archived branches, and experimental forks are not guaranteed to receive patches.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please do **not** open a public issue for exploitable security bugs.

Preferred path:

1. Use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting ("Report a vulnerability") in this repository.
2. Include:
   - affected version/commit
   - impact summary
   - minimal reproduction steps
   - suggested mitigation (if known)

If private reporting is unavailable in your environment, open a minimal issue without exploit details and request a private contact channel.

## Response Targets

- Initial acknowledgment: within 72 hours
- Triage update: within 7 days
- Fix timeline: depends on severity and blast radius

## Disclosure Guidelines

- Please allow time for triage and patching before public disclosure.
- Credit is provided in release notes/changelog unless you request anonymity.
